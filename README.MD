Run Away is a side-scrolling platformer RPG game inspired by 2D indie hits like Celeste, Hollow Knight, and Towerfall.

It tells the story of a boy named Tye, our main character, going through his parents’ divorce. The intention was to subtely hint at this story element through implicit storytelling, visual elements and an ending cutscene.

The game was meant to be a way to help younger kids who are going through the same thing with their families, by offering advice and help alongside compelling gameplay.

The player’s end goal is to guide Tye through his emotions and help him through this pivotal time in his life, navigating through his own emotions figuratively and physically, as all the emotions associated with his experiences manifest in the variety of levels Tye goes through. Battle through rain, wind, snow, and lightning to reach the end, to help Tye find a way home (or not?).
